# HomeQuranLearning.QA — Project State

## Purpose and authority

Canonical resumable project checkpoint. Use it with Git and actual repository state after reboot, new Codex chat, interrupted phase or missing chat history.

Chat history is not authoritative. Repository state + this file are the durable project state.

## Canonical checkpoint

- Branch: `main`
- Base commit: `32202b3b4202515a684373bfbf6500e8a4e7eef7`
- S1 implementation commit: `ca18589d2d027a07b300cc86fbeadda49540f968`
- S1 closure commit: `c68f6e2b5f6088447243afa494e17eeb7716748a`
- S1.1 release parent: `a97cd465cef4811b58491a781eb5e02fc63771e6`
- Origin: local `main` and `origin/main` synchronized after S1.1 release verification
- Subject: `fix(recordings): handle unavailable playback cleanly`
- Latest closed product phase: `S1.1 - deleted recording playback stabilization`
- Latest closed governance phase: `CODEX AUTOPILOT GOVERNANCE BOOTSTRAP`
- Current product phase: `BETWEEN PHASES - S1.1 closed`
- Current phase status: `BETWEEN_PHASES`
- Next engineering gate: discuss and approve the next remaining stabilization phase; do not automatically start `7A-2`
- Waiting human test: no
- Waiting release approval: no
- Last verified checkpoint: S1.1 was fully validated, release-approved and pushed; authorized `Deleted` playback returns HTTP 400 while existing `Uploaded` playback returns HTTP 200; isolated proof data was removed; API/Agent/FFmpeg returned OFF
- Tests already passed for S1.1: targeted deleted-recording regression 1/1; full unit 76/76; integration 2/2; Agent 1/1; full solution build GREEN with 0 warnings and 0 errors; runtime HTTP Deleted 400 / Uploaded 200 proof GREEN; final diff/status review and `git diff --check` GREEN
- Tests still required: none for S1.1; remaining follow-ups are tracked below
- S1.1 release files: `docs/PROJECT-STATE.md`, `src/Backend/Academy.Api/Program.cs`, `src/Backend/Academy.Application/Exceptions/RecordingUnavailableException.cs`, `src/Backend/Academy.Application/Services/RecordingService.cs`, `tests/Academy.UnitTests/RecordingServiceTests.cs`
- Temporary data: the isolated S1.1 Deleted-recording proof row was removed; proof row count returned to zero and the recordings baseline returned to 148
- Product runtime expected after latest proof: OFF

S1 and S1.1 are CLOSED after full validation and release approval. `7A-2` has not started.

## Current runtime snapshot

Verified 2026-08-27:

- `.dev-runtime/Runtime.ps1`: API OFF, Agent OFF, FFmpeg 0
- Docker: PostgreSQL, Redis, MinIO, LiveKit, LiveKit Ingress and ingress-manager running
- Windows service `AcademyQaWorker`: Running / Automatic

The `AcademyQaWorker` service remains Running/Automatic and is wired to the repository worker source. Its current source passes all self-test markers and a live read-only API probe, but Windows denied service-control and child-process termination, so the long-running service process itself could not be refreshed. Keep this operational caveat visible after release.

## Proven architecture

Backend:
- ASP.NET Core
- .NET 10
- EF Core
- PostgreSQL

Infrastructure:
- PostgreSQL
- Redis
- MinIO
- LiveKit
- LiveKit Ingress
- ingress-manager
- Docker Compose

Dashboard:
- Next.js
- React
- TypeScript

Agent:
- Academy.Agent.Service
- Academy.Agent.Cloud
- Academy.Agent.Audio
- Academy.Agent.Capture
- Academy.Agent.Media
- Academy.Agent.Teams
- Academy.Agent.TeamsHelper

Live path:

```text
Agent -> FFmpeg RTMP -> LiveKit Ingress -> LiveKit -> browser dashboard
```

Known-good screen timing:

```text
ddagrab
framerate=10
dup_frames=1
hwdownload
format=bgra
setpts=N/(10*TB)
```

Audio:

```text
NAudio/WASAPI loopback -> UDP -> FFmpeg AAC -> LiveKit
```

Recording uses direct H264 MP4 rather than huge raw BGRA temp files.

## Completed foundations

- JWT + HTTP-only cookie auth
- Owner/Admin/Manager roles and partial Manager teacher filtering
- teachers/students/courses/devices
- schedules/sessions
- historical session safety
- session events
- live screen/audio
- dashboard audio control
- recording/upload/recovery
- attendance reducer/review/daily report
- QA rules/alerts foundation

These foundations do not mean authorization, durable service startup, manual-session workflow, or the Owner Control Plane is complete.

## Teams attendance — completed

```text
Academy.Agent.Service
<-> secured Named Pipe
<-> Academy.Agent.TeamsHelper
-> Teams UI Automation
```

Event types:

```text
TeacherGreetingSent  = 19
CallAttempted        = 20
StudentCallConnected = 21
CallEnded            = 22
LessonShared         = 23
```

Source: `TeamsUIAutomation`

Current semantics:

- TeacherGreetingSent = teacher evidence, not student presence
- CallAttempted = teacher evidence, not student presence
- StudentCallConnected = explicit student presence
- CallEnded = stop/duration evidence
- LessonShared = strong teacher and student participation/presence evidence
- LessonShared timestamp is not a student arrival timestamp and must not by itself cause Late

Late threshold: 3 minutes.
Pre-class teacher-ready window: 5 minutes.

LessonShared requires exact scheduled student chat + outgoing lesson-related text + actual image in same message.

Known reducer test example:

```text
StudentCallConnected +2m
CallEnded +12m
=> Present
=> ActiveSeconds 600
```

Targeted attendance reducer suite after Teams integration: `27/27 green`.

## Phase 7A-1 — closed GREEN

Commit: `415bbec`

Implemented:

- pending recording exposes StartedAtUtc
- alert request exposes QaRuleId
- Whisper model reuse
- normalized transcript indexing
- cross-segment phrase matching
- recording-relative timestamps
- exact rule linkage
- duplicate retry suppression
- mark processed only after success
- failure remains pending

Worker self-test:

```text
QA_WORKER_TRANSCRIPT_INDEX_OK
QA_WORKER_CROSS_SEGMENT_MATCH_OK
QA_WORKER_RULE_LINK_OK
QA_WORKER_TIMESTAMP_ALIGNMENT_OK
QA_WORKER_SELF_TEST_OK
```

Gates:

- full solution build GREEN
- unit 67/67
- integration 2/2
- production runtime/API/DB proof GREEN

Proven:
- StartedAtUtc reaches worker
- exact QaRuleId persists
- recording-relative alert timestamp persists
- duplicate alert retry suppressed
- QaProcessedAtUtc persists only after explicit success
- processed recording disappears from pending queue
- temporary proof data cleaned

Historical proof counts:

```text
Recordings 148
QA Rules 1
QA Alerts 5
Sessions 20
Session Events 163
```

Not permanent invariants.

QA worker remains production-wired at `spikes/SttSpike/qa_worker.py`.

## Known non-blocking issue

`.dev-runtime/Runtime.ps1 StartApi` may briefly report API OFF immediately after launch while HTTP readiness later succeeds. Use explicit bounded readiness checks.

## S1 - closed

Implemented:

- Owner/Admin role policy on user, people, assignment, QA-rule, QA-alert write, device-management and manual-session routes.
- Manager recording playback restricted to recordings belonging to assigned teachers.
- Manager live-session visibility and LiveKit tokens restricted to active sessions belonging to assigned teachers.
- Manager denied LiveKit server credentials and publish-capable participant tokens; Owner/Admin token workflows remain available.
- Unknown roles fail closed for dashboard recordings, alerts and devices.
- Corrected Owner policy recorded durably: `LessonShared` proves both teacher and student presence but is not an arrival/late timestamp.

Proof:

- full solution build: GREEN
- focused attendance/access tests: 35/35
- unit tests: 75/75
- integration tests: 2/2
- Agent tests: 1/1
- local API Owner/Admin/Manager policy and assigned/unassigned resource proof: GREEN
- temporary runtime proof cleanup: GREEN, zero remaining rows
- QA worker current-source self-test and read-only API probe: GREEN
- exact service-process refresh: not achieved because host service/process control returned Access Denied

S1 implementation release files:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `README.md`
- `docs/PROJECT-DECISIONS.md`
- `docs/PROJECT-STATE.md`
- `docs/architecture/current-state.md`
- `docs/architecture/overview.md`
- `docs/decisions/coding-conventions.md`
- `src/Backend/Academy.Api/Program.cs`
- `src/Backend/Academy.Application/Services/DashboardQueryService.cs`
- `tests/Academy.UnitTests/DashboardResourceAccessTests.cs`

## S1.1 - closed

Goal:

- Replace the HTTP 500 returned for an authorized playback request against a historical `Deleted` recording with the established unavailable-recording client response, without changing authorization or healthy uploaded playback.

Root cause:

- `RecordingService.GetPlaybackUrlAsync` represented every non-`Uploaded` status with a generic `InvalidOperationException`.
- The `/api/admin/recordings/{recordingId}/playback-url` endpoint did not map that known domain condition, so ASP.NET Core surfaced it as HTTP 500 after authorization had correctly succeeded.

Released:

- A typed `RecordingUnavailableException` carries the current recording status.
- `RecordingService` throws that exception before requesting a presigned URL for any non-`Uploaded` recording.
- The playback endpoint maps only that known exception to HTTP 400 with the existing `Recording file is not available.` response.
- A regression test proves `Deleted` status raises the typed unavailable condition and never calls storage.

Proof:

- targeted deleted-recording regression: 1/1 GREEN
- full unit tests: 76/76 GREEN
- integration tests: 2/2 GREEN
- Agent tests: 1/1 GREEN
- full solution build: GREEN, 0 warnings, 0 errors
- authenticated runtime HTTP proof: isolated `Deleted` recording returned 400; existing `Uploaded` control returned 200
- cleanup: isolated proof row count zero; recordings baseline restored to 148
- runtime after proof: API OFF, Agent OFF, FFmpeg 0

Protected behavior:

- Existing authorization and manager resource-scope checks still execute before playback resolution.
- Uploaded recording presigned-URL behavior is unchanged.
- Download endpoint behavior, recording lifecycle, storage, LiveKit, Teams, attendance and QA processing semantics are unchanged.

## Current engineering gate - post-S1 reassessment

S1 closed the immediate role and resource-scope defects. Remaining stabilization and future authorization observations are:

1. Full granular permission-catalog enforcement remains future Owner Control Plane phase O1 work; S1 intentionally applies existing role and assignment boundaries only.
2. The running QA worker service process could not be refreshed under the current host permissions, although current source/runtime probes are green.
3. The historical `Deleted`-recording HTTP 500 follow-up was resolved and released in S1.1. Runtime proof returned Deleted 400, Uploaded 200, and S1 authorization ordering remains unchanged.
4. TeamsHelper lacks a verified durable launcher/installer/startup mechanism.
5. Manual-session workflow is incomplete.
6. Agent configuration contains environment-specific FFmpeg/device assumptions and recording is disabled by default.
7. Production Compose omits some live/reverse-proxy components and needs deliberate deployment design later.

After S1 closure, reassess the remaining stabilization observations before starting `7A-2`. `7A-2` remains the next planned QA feature, not an unconditional next action.

## Planned QA phase — 7A-2 (not started)

Durable timestamped transcript segment persistence.

Likely concerns:

- RecordingId
- deterministic SegmentIndex
- relative StartSeconds/EndSeconds
- Text
- language
- meaningful Whisper metadata
- retry/idempotency
- batch/transaction behavior

Correctness requirement: if transcript persistence succeeds but later alert processing fails, retry must not duplicate transcript segments.

Worker order should become:

```text
download
-> transcribe
-> persist segments
-> evaluate/persist alerts
-> mark QA processed only after all success
```

Evidence clips remain a later phase.

## Owner/Codex workflow decisions

Maximum safe automation is desired.

Routine Codex work should handle:
- inspection/search
- PowerShell
- source editing
- builds/tests
- Docker/PostgreSQL
- API/Agent/runtime lifecycle
- browser/dashboard tests
- safe Teams test automation
- temporary proof data
- cleanup
- failure diagnosis

No fake fixes, ignored failures, hidden errors or false green reports.

Human-only gates include real Teams mobile answer/speech/listening, MFA/OTP, physical device interaction and genuine business decisions.

Use checkpoint: `HUMAN TEST REQUIRED`

Dashboard/browser testing should be automated where possible. Never commit passwords/tokens/cookies.

Teams automation is limited to explicitly approved test target. If mobile/student human action is required, stop and wait.

Before every coherent major-phase commit/push, provide detailed release summary and stop at:

`RELEASE APPROVAL REQUIRED`

Owner approval keyword:

`APPROVE`

No major-phase commit/push before APPROVE.

After successful push, report actual commit hash, push result, clean worktree and phase-close summary.

Then explain next major phase in detail and wait for:

`GO`

During autonomous work send concise `CHECKPOINT GREEN X/Y` updates after meaningful milestones.

After laptop restart/new Codex chat, owner should only need:

`Continue project`

Codex must read project state/governance, inspect Git/runtime/source and resume from last verified checkpoint.

## Owner Control Plane — required, not implemented

`docs/OWNER-CONTROL-PLANE.md` is authoritative desired product policy.

The product must gain a separate Owner control surface with backend-enforced role + granular permission + resource scope; templates/custom grants and effective-access preview; durable Admin↔Manager and Manager↔Teacher assignments/history; configurable recording retention; durable audit; system health; and secure centralized device/Main-Agent lifecycle.

Likely future tracks are O1 authorization/permission foundation, O2 organization control, O3 retention, O4 device-management foundation, and O5 remote Agent lifecycle. Stabilization first closes immediate authorization defects. None of O1–O5 is currently implemented as a complete phase.

## Codex governance status

Project-wide governance was committed and pushed at `32202b3b4202515a684373bfbf6500e8a4e7eef7`. Status is `CLOSED`.

Root `AGENTS.md` is the repository-wide governance file. The existing `src/Dashboard/academy-dashboard/AGENTS.md` adds only Next.js/dashboard-specific guidance.

Project-local `.codex/config.toml` requests `workspace-write`, `on-request`, and the supported native Windows elevated sandbox. Project rules allow routine read-only Git inspection, prompt on commit/push, and forbid destructive Git patterns. These project-local layers load only when the repository is trusted.

Committed bootstrap files:

- `.codex/config.toml`
- `.codex/rules/default.rules`
- `AGENTS.md`
- `README.md`
- `docs/PROJECT-STATE.md`
- `docs/CODEX-WORKFLOW.md`
- `docs/OWNER-CONTROL-PLANE.md`
- `docs/architecture/ADR-001-system-architecture.md`
- `docs/architecture/current-state.md`
- `docs/architecture/overview.md`
- `docs/architecture/qa-worker-service.md`
- `docs/decisions/coding-conventions.md`

No product source, migration, or test file belongs in this bootstrap.

## Production deployment

Deferred until local product completeness/stabilization and explicit owner approval.

## Resume checklist

1. Read this file.
2. Read `docs/architecture/current-state.md`.
3. Inspect branch/HEAD/status.
4. Inspect staged/uncommitted files.
5. Inspect runtime.
6. Determine whether current phase is closed, in progress, waiting human test, waiting release approval or blocked.
7. If the recorded status is `WAITING_RELEASE_APPROVAL`, do not stage/commit/push or start the next phase.
8. Resume only from verified state.
